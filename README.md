####How to build a beacon

Building a beacon is very similar to a normal beacon. You build a pyramid of up to 4 layers (inclusive) then place a beacon on top. You then place your player head on top of the beacon and it'll automatically start applying buffs

Each beacon layer is one extra level on a buff so a full size beacon can give you 4 level 4 buffs! However with all that power comes "bad stuff"

####Corruption

You can't just go tapping into the raw power of the End without some downsides and the comes in the form of corruption. By holding a crystal over a beacon, you can see it's current corruption level. Let that get too and you're gonna have a real bad time, seriously. I don't mess about.

"So great mistress, what can I do about corruption?" I hear you cry. Well let me tell you. Firstly I'll tell you a bit more about your beacon. Your beacon can support 1 "amount" of "buffs" per level. So if you have a beacon with 4 layers/levels, you have 4 "points". These points don't generate corruption.
So let's keep with that. We have a level 4 beacon. This means we can spend these "points" in either 1 level 4 buff, 2 level 2 buffs, 4 level 1 buffs etc. You get the idea. With a level 2 beacon, 1 level 2 buff or 2 level 1 buffs etc.
Now making sure you never "spend" more then those "points", you'll have a perfectly stable beacon. Crystals aren't forever though. After 24 hours real time, they'll turn into depleted crystals.

Now if you are crazy and still want more buffs that your beacon can support, you can release corruption by using a crystal on a beacon. This will expel any built up corruption and reset it to 0. But it won't release it for free, it'll still cost you.
This is handy if you now have a balanced beacon but some left over corruption built up in it. It's never a good idea to even have a small amount of corruption.

As mentioned, even the smallest amount of corruption is a pain in the ass. the amount of corruption you generate varies based on how many crystals you have slotted and your difficulty level. Any amount of corruption has a chance of pulling an enderman in from the end.

Level 1 corruption will tinge you a little

Level 2 corruption will disorient you as it grasps at your soul

Level 3 corruption, well let's just say you never ever want to get to this level. EVER.

####Player heads

I have added in a few methods of getting a players head.

The first method is cheaty. Do /playerhead playername and tada! It has tab competition however the player name is case sensitive!

The next one is an enchant. Only good for getting other players heads however if you enchant your sword with "Decaptitation", depending on what level will change what chance the enemy has of dropping their head.

Occasionally, you will rise from the grave. To a degree that is. Zombies will randomly spawn with your head in the world you're in. Good luck finding them!

Now for the fun one everyone loves. The Beheader. Yup. It's a helmet that if you wear it, it will chop your head off. It will even chop off your enemies heads! Just click on them with it and they'll wear it. However those pesky helmets will prevent you from doing that.
If you do manage to though, they will be notified that it was you who did it and that they are wearing it!
